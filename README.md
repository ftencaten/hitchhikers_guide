# A Hitchhiker's Guide to Bioinformatics Analysis
A compilation of tutorials, books, and vignettes covering different topics in bioinformatics analysis.

During my journey as a bioinformatician, I relied numerous times on well-written 
materials that helped me understand the available tools and methods and their 
applicability to different biological problems. This repository is an effort to spread 
this material and help other researchers navigate 
the intricacies of bioinformatics analysis and easily find those planning charts 
that have been sitting at the local planning department in Alpha Centauri for years.
