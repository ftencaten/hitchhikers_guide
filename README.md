# A Hitchhiker's Guide to Bioinformatics Analysis
A compilation of tutorials, books, and vignettes covering different topics in bioinformatics analysis.

During my journey as a bioinformatician, I often relied on well-written materials 
that helped me understand the available tools and methods and their applicability 
to different biological problems. This repository is an effort to share these 
resources and help other researchers navigate the intricacies of bioinformatics 
analysis. Hopefully, it will also make it easier to find those planning charts that 
have been sitting at the local planning department in Alpha Centauri for years.
